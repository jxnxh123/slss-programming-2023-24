Modules are bits of code that we can use in python
These bits of code are not automatically included, so
we need to import them into our code


# import
the `import` keyword loads the module into our file 
`imports` should be at the top of the file under the header



# The `Time` module
Time allows us to play around with anything related to time
We can pause our code using `time
```python
import time

# pause code for 1.5 seconds
time.sleep(1.5)
`
