# Design

The design process are the steps that we take when we create a solution to a problem

There are four steps in our design process
## 1.  Design our Algorithm in English 9 or any human language)
An algorithm is a sequence of steps to solve a problem.
In this class before we start ANY programming, we write our steps in english.

## 2. Translate our Algorithm from English to Python
we'll translate our algorithm into "proper" Python.

## 3. Test our Python Algorithm
Check if it works syntactically.  In other words, we ask does our algorithm actually solve the problem.

## 4. Share our work
Once it solves our problem, ship your code to whoever will use it.# Design
