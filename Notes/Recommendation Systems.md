## Popularity and Likes

this type of paradigm makes a suggestion based on how many people like the thing. 

one prime example is the like button (heart) on instagram.
When you click the heart, instagram records it, and based on information
it has on you, it might suggest that to someone else that is similar to you.

we created the favourite bubble tea service which is based on the "popularity/likes" paradigm of recommendation systems

# N-Point rating Systems

N-point rating systems are used by many services but one that nearly everyone is familiar with is Amazons main purchasing service.

This Paradigm is where users rate a product out of a certain number.



## Similarity scores

Amazon and Netflix and Meta all use similarity scores to help drive users to their platform. 

>Example:
>Ubial likes [" nintendo switch", "usb chargers", "4k blu ray movies"]
>Ben ubial likes ["ninendo switch", "usb chargers", "lego"]
>fido likes [" lego", "dog food", "chew toys" ]
