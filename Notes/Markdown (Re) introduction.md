We create headings in Markdown using hash (#) symbols  
To create subheadings, we can use multiple hash symbols  
## This is a level 2 subheading 
### This is a level 3 subheading
###### This is a level 6 subheading

# Modifying Text Style  
## Bold and Italics  
We use asterisks (\*) to modify text styling, specifically bold and italics  
e.g.  
I want this **word** specifically to be bold  
I want this *word* to be italicized  
I want this ***word*** to be both bold and italicized
## Escape Characters  
**ASIDE**: If we want to place a character that is a **KEYWORD** or *reserved word*, and we want the LITERAL character, use the backslash (\\)  
	e.g if we want to put an asterisk, we do this \\\*
## Strikethrough  
We can also strike through characters using the tilde (~)  
I want to strikethrough this specific ~~word~~  
~~This sentence is struck through~~
# Links  
We can link things in our Markdown files  
[One tool to use.]([https://chat.openai.com](https://chat.openai.com/))  
Exercise:  
* if you an openai account, do the following:  
	* ask chatgpt to create for you markdown code that is a link to two websites of your choice  
* If you don't have chatgpt/openai, create two links to websites of your choice in the space below

e.g. [My favourite website right now]([https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions?hl=en](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions?hl=en))
[My favourite app]([https://www.youtube.com/](https://www.youtube.com/))  
[My favourite music platform]([https://open.spotify.com/](https://open.spotify.com/))

e.g. if you use open ai  
Put in their code, and in italics say that it's from chatgpt  
[A search engine ]([https://google.com](https://google.com/)) *from chatgpt*
# Images

# blockquotes
Block quotes allow us to emphasize a bigger chunk of text.
we use carets (>) ti create blockquotes.
> this is an example of a blockquote 
> this is line two of the blockquote


> this is the fourth line. The third one is blank.


# Lists
we can create both unordered and ordered lists 

# Unordered lists 
to create each point, we use (\*) with a space behind it
we can create sublists by placing TABS before the asterisk 
e.g
* dairy
	* eggs 
	* milk
	* cheese
* juice


## Ordered lists
if there is a specific order to the elements in our list,
we create ordered lists 
we use numbers, followed by periods to create ordered lists

e.g.
1. put butter into mixing bowl
2. add sugar to butter (*hold shift to get the second line*)
   add both brown and regular sugar 
3. use the mixer to cream the butter and sugar together 


# Tables 
We can organize information in tables using markdown.
We use dashes (-) and pipes (|)
Tables in markdown require headings

| Name        | Age        | Sign        | Superpower      |
| ---         | ---        | ---         | ---             |
| Bruce Wayne | 35         | Aquarius    | Intelligence/ $ |
| Mr. Ubial   | Unaging    | All of them | Dad strength    |
| Yourself    | Your age   | Your Sign   | Super strength  |
