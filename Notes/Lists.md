A list in python is a collection of items
We can store different *values* in a list 
**Order matters** in a list

# Creating a list
To make a list we use brackets \[\] to surround our list
We separate out the items using ,

```python
some_list = ["John," "Tim", "Sarah"]
```

# Access Elements in a list
we can grab things from lists using the bracket notation 
In our example above, if I wanted to access "Tim", I Would do the following

```python
some_list[1]     # "Tim"  
some_list[2]     # "sarah"
some_list[-1]    # "sarah" 
some_list[-2]    # "Tim"


```

Inside the brackets, we say the index of the value we want
Python uses *0-index* counting, which means it starts counting from 0
