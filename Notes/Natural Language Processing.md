# Natural Language Processing
## Output
We can use a function to display texts and symbols to the screen
We use the `print`() function to display output

```python
print("your text goes in here")
```

## [[Headers]]

comments are pieces of texts that are not interpreted by python.
This means that the text is **ignored**
we use the # symbol to make comments
```python

```


# Input
We can grab information from the user using the input function ()
When we run the function, it does two things:
1. it waits for the user to write something
2. the user presses **Enter/Return** to indicate that its finished

```python
imput()

input (<prompt>)
```

## Variables
Variables allow us to store information for the time that our app runs

```python
favourite_food = input ("what is your favourite food? ")

```

Favourite_food -> name of the variable
= -> assignment operator
input... -> value 

# [[ strings]]
