# Natural Language Processing
## Output
We can use a function to display texts and symbols to the screen
We use the `print`() function to display output

```python
print("your text goes in here")
```

## [[Headers]]

comments are pieces of texts that are not interpreted by python.
This means that the text is **ignored**
we use the # symbol to make comments
```python

```


# Input
We can grab information from the user using the input function ()
When we run the function, it does two things:
1. it waits for the user to write something
2. the user presses **Enter/Return** to indicate that its finished

```python
imput()

input (<prompt>)
```

## Variables
Variables allow us to store information for the time that our app runs

```python
favourite_food = input ("what is your favourite food? ")

```

Favourite_food -> name of the variable
= -> assignment operator
input... -> value 

# Naming
What you can do:
1. name them with letters and numbers
2. names should start with a lowercase letter
What you cant do:
1. you cant name them with spaces or symbols
2. you cant name them with certain names that are reserved

A good name is something like this:
```python
favourite_food
fave_food
fate_of_birth
```


Bad names are like this:
```python
Favourite_food
a
num
aa
aaa
```

# [[Strings]]

# Design

The design process are the steps that we take when we create a solution to a problem

There are four steps in our design process
## 1.  Design our Algorithm in English 9 or any human language)
An algorithm is a sequence of steps to solve a problem.
In this class before we start ANY programming, we write our steps in english.

## 2. Translate our Algorithm from English to Python
we'll translate our algorithm into "proper" Python.

## 3. Test our Python Algorithm
Check if it works syntactically.  In other words, we ask does our algorithm actually solve the problem.

## 4. Share our work
Once it solves our problem, ship your code to whoever will use it.
